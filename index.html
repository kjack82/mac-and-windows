<h2>Apple</h2>

<p>Let's take a look at 3 of the best apple laptops;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Apple 2023 MacBook Pro M3 Pro chip with 11-core CPU</li>
    <li>Apple 2023 MacBook Pro M3 Max chip with 14 core CPU</li>
    <li>Apple 2024 Macbook Air 13-inch with M3 chip</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us take a look at 3 of the best Windows laptops;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Dell XPS 15</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy Book 3</li>
    <li>Asus Zenbook 14 flip</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>What about price tags?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Top MacBook will set you back at least 1899 GBP</li>
    <li>MacBook Air at least 1049 GBP</li>
    <li>Samsung at least $1900</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to my own views - I've always used a Windows, however recently moved to a MacBook Air 2024 model</p>
<p>Whilst I am still new to it, and cannout find the key for GBP as I bought the item in Australia, I must admit</p>
<p>I am really loving the machine so far. However cost of course and use must be considered!</p>
<strong>Please do your own research and do not listen to me! I have no bloody idea!</strong>
